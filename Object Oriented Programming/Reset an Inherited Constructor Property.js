function Animal() { }
function Bird() { }
function Dog() { }

Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

// Only change code below this line
Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird;
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;
// i jsut add these two lines


let duck = new Bird();
let beagle = new Dog();

/*
When an object inherits its prototype from another object, it also inherits the supertype's constructor property.

Here's an example:

function Bird() { }
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
let duck = new Bird();
duck.constructor // function Animal(){...}
But duck and all instances of Bird should show that they were constructed by Bird and not Animal. To do so, you can manually set Bird's constructor property to the Bird object:

Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird;
duck.constructor // function Bird(){...}
Fix the code so duck.constructor and beagle.constructor return their respective constructors.
